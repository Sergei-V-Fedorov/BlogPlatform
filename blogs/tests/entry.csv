get_or_create(),"A convenience method for looking up an object with the given kwargs (may be empty if your model has defaults for all fields), creating one if necessary.

Returns a tuple of (object, created), where object is the retrieved or created object and created is a boolean specifying whether a new object was created.

This is meant to prevent duplicate objects from being created when requests are made in parallel, and as a shortcut to boilerplatish code. For example:

try:
    obj = Person.objects.get(first_name='John', last_name='Lennon')
except Person.DoesNotExist:
    obj = Person(first_name='John', last_name='Lennon', birthday=date(1940, 10, 9))
    obj.save()

Here, with concurrent requests, multiple attempts to save a Person with the same parameters may be made. To avoid this race condition, the above example can be rewritten using get_or_create() like so:

obj, created = Person.objects.get_or_create(
    first_name='John',
    last_name='Lennon',
    defaults={'birthday': date(1940, 10, 9)},
)
